# 3d-reconstruction-preprocessing
| This repository is used for executing recent 3D reconstruction methods.

## A list of methods I executed (There are more methods I studied)
- [MiVOS](https://github.com/hkchengrex/MiVOS)
- [COLMAP](https://colmap.github.io/index.html)
- [PIFuHD](https://shunsukesaito.github.io/PIFuHD/)

These codes are tiny methods for image resizing, mask binarization, etc.
And especially, these are necessary for using the COLMAP method.
